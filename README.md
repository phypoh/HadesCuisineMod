# Features
Talk to the head chef once per run, and choose among 3 delicious meals. These will grant buffs that offer you to play outside your comfort zone and experiment. You can only eat 1 meal before each run, so choose wisely then plan your boons around the meal you ate! To eat a meal simply walk up to the chef in the House of Hades, and interact with him like you normally would (except you don't need fish). Then, select one of 3 meals from the menu, and you're set!
